- **mcc (mobile country code)** : An MCC is used in combination with an MNC (a combination known as an "MCC/MNC tuple") to uniquely identify a mobile network operator (carrier) using the 5G public land mobile networks
   - [To check mcc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_country_code)
 - **mnc (mobile network code)** : A unique identifier used in conjunction with a mobile country code (MCC) to identify a mobile network operator.
   - [To check mnc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_country_code)
 - **snssaiList** : To uniquely identify a  Network Slice, the 5G system defines the S-NSSAI (Single â€“ Network Slice Selection Assistance Information).S-NSSAI is made up of two field SST (Slice/Service Type) and SD (Service Differentiator). SD is an optional field. SST has 8 bit field length implying that it can indicates a total of 255 different slice types.
  - **SST** : this will define the expected behaviour of the Network Slice in terms of specific features and services , such as [V2X](https://www.google.com/search?q=v2x+services+provided+by+5g+technology+is+for&oq=v2x+ser&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqDAgBEAAYQxiABBiKBTIGCAAQRRg5MgwIARAAGEMYgAQYigUyBwgCEAAYgAQyBwgDEAAYgAQyCAgEEAAYFhgeMggIBRAAGBYYHjIICAYQABgWGB4yCAgHEAAYFhgeMg0ICBAuGAoYFhgeGOUEMg0ICRAAGIYDGIAEGIoF0gEINTcxM2owajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

  - **SD (slice differentiator)** : this is optional information that complements the Slice/Service type and is used as an additional differentiator if multiple Network Slices carry the same SST value

- **nr_cellid** : Uniquely identifies a cell within a PLMN. It is often constructed from gNodeB ID + Physical Cell ID. 36-bit string identifying an NR Cell Id
  - NCI = gNB_ ID * 2^(36-gNB_ID_bit_length) + CI
Example: gNB_ ID_ When the length is 24 bits, the CI length is 12 bits, NCI=gNBID * (2 ^ 12)+CI=gNBID * 4096+CI. Because CI occupies the 12th place, there are a total of 4096 communities [here](https://www.telecomhall.net/t/what-is-the-formula-for-cell-id-nci-in-5g-nr-networks/12623/8)
