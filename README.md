- **mcc (mobile country code)** : An MCC is used in combination with an MNC (a combination known as an "MCC/MNC tuple") to uniquely identify a mobile network operator (carrier) using the 5G public land mobile networks

 - **mnc (mobile network code)** : A unique identifier used in conjunction with a mobile country code (MCC) to identify a mobile network operator.
   - [To check mnc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_country_code)
 - **snssaiList** : To uniquely identify a  Network Slice, the 5G system defines the S-NSSAI (Single â€“ Network Slice Selection Assistance Information).S-NSSAI is made up of two field SST (Slice/Service Type) and SD (Service Differentiator). SD is an optional field. SST has 8 bit field length implying that it can indicates a total of 255 different slice types.
  - **SST** : this will define the expected behaviour of the Network Slice in terms of specific features and services , such as [V2X](https://www.google.com/search?q=v2x+services+provided+by+5g+technology+is+for&oq=v2x+ser&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqDAgBEAAYQxiABBiKBTIGCAAQRRg5MgwIARAAGEMYgAQYigUyBwgCEAAYgAQyBwgDEAAYgAQyCAgEEAAYFhgeMggIBRAAGBYYHjIICAYQABgWGB4yCAgHEAAYFhgeMg0ICBAuGAoYFhgeGOUEMg0ICRAAGIYDGIAEGIoF0gEINTcxM2owajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

  - **SD (slice differentiator)** : this is optional information that complements the Slice/Service type and is used as an additional differentiator if multiple Network Slices carry the same SST value

- **nr_cellid** : Uniquely identifies a cell within a PLMN. It is often constructed from gNodeB ID + Physical Cell ID. 36-bit string identifying an NR Cell Id
  - NCI = gNB_ ID * 2^(36-gNB_ID_bit_length) + CI
Example: gNB_ ID_ When the length is 24 bits, the CI length is 12 bits, NCI=gNBID * (2 ^ 12)+CI=gNBID * 4096+CI. Because CI occupies the 12th place, there are a total of 4096 communities [here](https://www.telecomhall.net/t/what-is-the-formula-for-cell-id-nci-in-5g-nr-networks/12623/8)

- **PDCCH_ConfigSIB1**  = Value of this IE is a 8 bits length , for example **178** , converting to binary will give `1011 0010`
  - First 4 bits (MSB) will determine the "controlResourceSetZero" Index , this will indicate the Number of RB/symbols used to determine the CORESET seize of the type0 PDCCH Common Seasrch Space. In the above example **11** i.e `1011`
  - Last 4 Bits (LSB) will determine the "searchSpaceZero" Index, this will indicate the PDCCH Monitoring Occasions , meaning the System Frame Number & Slot Index that the UE need to monitor for the Type0-PDCCH common search space . In above example **2** i.e `0010`
  - therefore **PDCCH_ConfigSIB1** of the give command ( not the example ) = `1011 0000` = **176**

- **ControlResourceSetZero** : Number of Consecutive RB's in the Coreset & Number of OFDM symbols assigned for the PDCCH are determined.
  - example : for n41 , SCS of SSB = 30 , min BW (Mhz) = 5/10 following tables from TS 38.213 13-1 to 13-10 are used to determine the Corset RB',Symbols & the RB Offset (Starting point of the Coreset).

- The following are determined from the above table
  1. **OFFSET** = 14 RBs from "offsetTocarrier" this will be the starting point to the Coreset#0
  2.  **Number of RBs** = There will be 48 consecutive RBs that will make up the Coreset#0 (Number of RBs) 
  3. **number of symbols** = 1 symbol is occupied by PDCCH
  5.**Multiplexing Pattern** = 1,  is used to determine the Type 0 PDCCH Common Search space Monitoring occasion, This is used in **SearchSpaceZero**

- **SearchSpaceZero** : used to determine the Type 0 PDCCH Search Space Monitoring occasion, meaning it determines the System Frame Number (SFNc) & Slot Index where Type0-PDCCH (Carrying the SI RNTI) can be monitored
Based on the CORSET **Multiplexing pattern** & Frequency Range following 38.213 13-11 to 13-14 tables are used to determine the System Frame Number (SFNc) and Slot Index for monitoring PDCCH.

- looking up the **SSZ** index = 2 that we decoded from **PDCCH_ConfigSIB1** we get the following info
  1. O: It specifies a slot offset relative to the start of the frame
  2. M: it variable is related to the Number of Search Space Sets per Slot
  3. First Symbol Index: specifics the starting symbol for the Search Space Set within the slot
- have to look more on SearchSpaceZero

- **absoluteFrequencySSB** : It represent the center frequency of SSB Block
- **absoluteFrequencyPointA** : It represents the common reference point A
- **offsetToPointA** = It defines the frequency offset between point A and the lowest subcarrier of the RB overlapping with SSB. The unit for RB is expressed as 15KHz for FR1 and 60 KHz for FR2
- **Kssb** = it defines the frequency of RB#0 of SSB and The unit for RB is expressed as 15KHz for FR1 and 60 KHz for FR2
- **dl_offstToCarrier** : if dl_offstToCarrier is equal to 0, it means that the starting point of the communication at Point A aligns perfectly with the carrier frequency. There is no shift or difference in frequency; they match up directly. It's like saying they are on the same page in terms of where they are operating in the wireless spectrum.

- **ul_frequencyBand** : [n78](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G_NR_frequency_bands)
- **ul_offstToCarrier** :  If ul_offstToCarrier is equal to 0, it means that there is no frequency offset between the reference point (usually associated with the uplink, denoted by "ul") and the lowest usable subcarrier on the carrier. In other words, Point A aligns with the starting point of the carrier frequency, and there is no need to shift or offset the frequency in the uplink direction.If ul_offstToCarrier is equal to 0, it means that the starting point of the data transmission in the uplink (from your device, like a smartphone) aligns perfectly with the main frequency that the 5G network is using. There is no need for any adjustment or shift in the frequency for the uplink transmission. It's like your device is directly tuned to the right frequency without any offset.

- **ul_carrierBandwidth** = 273 i.e 100MHz
