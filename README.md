 - **snssaiList** : To uniquely identify a  Network Slice, the 5G system defines the S-NSSAI (Single â€“ Network Slice Selection Assistance Information).S-NSSAI is made up of two field SST (Slice/Service Type) and SD (Service Differentiator). SD is an optional field. SST has 8 bit field length implying that it can indicates a total of 255 different slice types.
  - **SST** : this will define the expected behaviour of the Network Slice in terms of specific features and services , such as [V2X](https://www.google.com/search?q=v2x+services+provided+by+5g+technology+is+for&oq=v2x+ser&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqDAgBEAAYQxiABBiKBTIGCAAQRRg5MgwIARAAGEMYgAQYigUyBwgCEAAYgAQyBwgDEAAYgAQyCAgEEAAYFhgeMggIBRAAGBYYHjIICAYQABgWGB4yCAgHEAAYFhgeMg0ICBAuGAoYFhgeGOUEMg0ICRAAGIYDGIAEGIoF0gEINTcxM2owajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

- **PDCCH_ConfigSIB1**  = Value of this IE is a 8 bits length , for example **178** , converting to binary will give `1011 0010`
  - First 4 bits (MSB) will determine the "controlResourceSetZero" Index , this will indicate the Number of RB/symbols used to determine the CORESET seize of the type0 PDCCH Common Seasrch Space. In the above example **11** i.e `1011`
  - Last 4 Bits (LSB) will determine the "searchSpaceZero" Index, this will indicate the PDCCH Monitoring Occasions , meaning the System Frame Number & Slot Index that the UE need to monitor for the Type0-PDCCH common search space . In above example **2** i.e `0010`
  - therefore **PDCCH_ConfigSIB1** of the give command ( not the example ) = `1011 0000` = **176**

- **ControlResourceSetZero** : Number of Consecutive RB's in the Coreset & Number of OFDM symbols assigned for the PDCCH are determined.
  - example : for n41 , SCS of SSB = 30 , min BW (Mhz) = 5/10 following tables from TS 38.213 13-1 to 13-10 are used to determine the Corset RB',Symbols & the RB Offset (Starting point of the Coreset).

- The following are determined from the above table
  1. **OFFSET** = 14 RBs from "offsetTocarrier" this will be the starting point to the Coreset#0
  2.  **Number of RBs** = There will be 48 consecutive RBs that will make up the Coreset#0 (Number of RBs) 
  3. **number of symbols** = 1 symbol is occupied by PDCCH
  5.**Multiplexing Pattern** = 1,  is used to determine the Type 0 PDCCH Common Search space Monitoring occasion, This is used in **SearchSpaceZero**

- **SearchSpaceZero** : used to determine the Type 0 PDCCH Search Space Monitoring occasion, meaning it determines the System Frame Number (SFNc) & Slot Index where Type0-PDCCH (Carrying the SI RNTI) can be monitored
Based on the CORSET **Multiplexing pattern** & Frequency Range following 38.213 13-11 to 13-14 tables are used to determine the System Frame Number (SFNc) and Slot Index for monitoring PDCCH.

- looking up the **SSZ** index = 2 that we decoded from **PDCCH_ConfigSIB1** we get the following info
  1. O: It specifies a slot offset relative to the start of the frame
  2. M: it variable is related to the Number of Search Space Sets per Slot
  3. First Symbol Index: specifics the starting symbol for the Search Space Set within the slot

- **ul_frequencyBand** : [n78](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G_NR_frequency_bands)
- **ul_offstToCarrier** :  If ul_offstToCarrier is equal to 0, it means that there is no frequency offset between the reference point (usually associated with the uplink, denoted by "ul") and the lowest usable subcarrier on the carrier. In other words, Point A aligns with the starting point of the carrier frequency, and there is no need to shift or offset the frequency in the uplink direction.If ul_offstToCarrier is equal to 0, it means that the starting point of the data transmission in the uplink (from your device, like a smartphone) aligns perfectly with the main frequency that the 5G network is using. There is no need for any adjustment or shift in the frequency for the uplink transmission. It's like your device is directly tuned to the right frequency without any offset.

- **prach_msg1_FDM** : The number of PRACH transmission occasions FDMed in one time instance. (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.3.3.2).
  - The "FDM" in "msg1-FDM" stands for Frequency Domain Multiplexing. This implies that multiple Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) transmission occasions are multiplexed in the frequency domain within one time instance. The PRACH is used by the UE to initiate communication with the network. So, "msg1-FDM" indicates that several PRACH transmission occasions are combined or multiplexed in the frequency domain during a specific time instance, likely to improve efficiency and utilize the available spectrum effectively. The exact number of PRACH transmission occasions FDMed in one time instance would be determined by the configuration and requirements of the specific 5G network deployment.
  - If "msg1-FDM = 2(1)," it likely means that, during the Random Access procedure in 5G, two PRACH transmission occasions are multiplexed in the frequency domain within one time instance. In other words, two devices or User Equipments (UEs) are attempting to initiate communication with the network at the same time, and their PRACH transmissions are separated in the frequency domain to avoid interference. This configuration may be part of the network's strategy to efficiently handle multiple devices attempting to connect simultaneously. The exact implications of "msg1-FDM = 2" would depend on the specific design and parameters of the 5G network being used.


- **prach_msg1_FrequencyStart** : Offset of lowest PRACH transmission occasion in frequency domain with respective to PRB 0. The value is configured so that the corresponding RACH resource is entirely within the bandwidth of the UL BWP. (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.3.3.2).
  - prach_msg1_FrequencyStart refers to the starting point or position of the first transmission occasion for a PRACH (Physical Random Access Channel) message in the frequency domain. The offset is measured with respect to PRB 0 (Physical Resource Block 0), which is a fundamental unit of frequency in 5G.
  - The purpose of configuring this value is to ensure that the resources allocated for the Random Access Channel (RACH) transmission are entirely within the bandwidth of the Uplink Bandwidth Part (UL BWP). This helps in efficient use of the available frequency spectrum in the uplink direction.
  - In other words, prach_msg1_FrequencyStart determines where in the frequency spectrum the initial transmission for a PRACH message begins, and this offset is set to make sure that it falls within the designated bandwidth for uplink communication.

- If prach_msg1_FrequencyStart = 22, it means that the first transmission for a certain type of communication in 5G (PRACH) starts at a specific position in the frequency spectrum, and that position is 22 steps away from the initial reference point (PRB 0). It's like saying, "Start talking at position 22 in the frequency range." This helps organize and manage communication resources efficiently.

- **preambleReceivedTargetPower** : The target power level at the network receiver side (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 7.4, TS 38.321 [3], clauses 5.1.2, 5.1.3). Only multiples of 2 dBm may be chosen (e.g. -202, -200, -198, ...)
  - A negative value indicates that the signal is weaker than the reference level.
  - having the value always a multiple of 2 might be a result of the way power levels are quantized or discretized in the system. The use of multiples of 2 could simplify the representation and processing of power values in the underlying technology.
  - In summary, the negative sign likely indicates a weaker signal compared to a reference, and the requirement for multiples of 2 might be a technical choice for the representation and handling of power levels in the specific system or protocol.


- **preambleTransMax** :  Max number of RA preamble transmission performed before declaring a failure (see TS 38.321 [3], clauses 5.1.4, 5.1.5).

- **powerRampingStep** : Power ramping steps for PRACH (see TS 38.321 [3],5.1.3). **Query**

- **ra_ResponseWindow** : Msg2 (RAR) window length in number of slots. The network configures a value lower than or equal to 10 ms when Msg2 is transmitted in licensed spectrum and a value lower than or equal to 40 ms when Msg2 is transmitted with shared spectrum channel access (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.4). UE ignores the field if included in SCellConfig. If ra-ResponseWindow-v1610 is signalled, UE shall ignore the ra-ResponseWindow (without suffix).
  - In simpler terms, "ra-ResponseWindow" refers to the time duration, measured in the number of slots, during which the network expects a response (Msg2 or RAR) from the user equipment (UE) in a wireless communication system. The specific configuration of this window depends on whether the message (Msg2) is transmitted in licensed spectrum or shared spectrum.
  - if Msg2 is sent in licensed spectrum, the window length is set to a value less than or equal to 10 milliseconds. On the other hand, if Msg2 is sent with shared spectrum channel access, the window length is set to a value less than or equal to 40 milliseconds.
  - In simpler terms, if "ra-ResponseWindow" is set to 5, it means that the network expects a response from the user equipment (UE) within a time window of 5 slots. This suggests that the UE has a specific duration, measured in slots, to acknowledge or respond to a message from the network. **The exact duration of each slot would depend on the specific characteristics of the wireless communication system in use**

- **ssb_perRACH_OccasionAndCB_PreamblesPerSSB_PR** : The meaning of this field is twofold: the CHOICE conveys the information about the number of SSBs per RACH occasion. Value oneEighth corresponds to one SSB associated with 8 RACH occasions, value oneFourth corresponds to one SSB associated with 4 RACH occasions, and so on. The ENUMERATED part indicates the number of Contention Based preambles per SSB. Value n4 corresponds to 4 Contention Based preambles per SSB, value n8 corresponds to 8 Contention Based preambles per SSB, and so on. The total number of CB preambles in a RACH occasion is given by CB-preambles-per-SSB * max(1, SSB-per-rach-occasion). See TS 38.213 [13].
  - ssb_perRACH_OccasionAndCB_PreamblesPerSSB_PR = half: This means there is one Synchronization Signal Block (SSB) for every two Random Access Channel (RACH) occasions. So, it associates one SSB with every two instances of the network's random access process.
  - ssb_perRACH_OccasionAndCB_PreamblesPerSSB_PR = n15: This indicates that there are 15 Contention Based (CB) preambles associated with each Synchronization Signal Block (SSB). So, when a device accesses the network using CB procedures related to a particular SSB, there are 15 preambles available for contention.
 

- **ra_ContentionResolutionTimer** : The initial value for the contention resolution timer (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.5). Value sf8 corresponds to 8 subframes, value sf16 corresponds to 16 subframes, and so on.
  - ra_ContentionResolutionTimer = 7 means s64 which corresponds to 64 subframes 

- **rsrp_ThresholdSSB** : UE may select the SS block and corresponding PRACH resource for path-loss estimation and (re)transmission based on SS blocks that satisfy the threshold (see TS 38.213 [13]).
  - In simpler terms, rsrp_ThresholdSSB is a parameter that helps a User Equipment (UE) decide which Synchronization Signal Block (SSB) to choose for path-loss estimation and potential retransmission. The UE makes this decision by selecting SS blocks that meet a certain signal strength threshold.
  - So, if the signal strength of an SS block (measured in RSRP, Reference Signal Received Power) is equal to or higher than the specified threshold, the UE may decide to use that SS block for activities like estimating how far the signal has traveled (path-loss estimation) or for potential retransmissions. The specific details and calculations related to this threshold are further defined in the technical specification TS 38.213 [13].
  - If rsrp_ThresholdSSB = 19, it means that the threshold for the Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) associated with Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSB) is set to 19.
  - In simpler terms, when your phone is deciding which SSB to use for tasks like estimating signal strength or retransmitting data, it will choose blocks where the RSRP is 19 or higher. This value essentially sets a standard for what is considered a strong enough signal for certain operations in the wireless communication system.
